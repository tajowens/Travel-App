## 1. Project Desciption
* **Title:** Trailblazer travel planner
* **Objective:** Develop an Android application to assist users with their travel plan.
* **Target Audience:** This app is targeted for users that travels more than three or more times a year.
## 2. Problem Addressing
* **Lack of Local Insights: Many travelers struggle to find authentic local experiences when visiting a new place. They often rely on generic tourist guides or miss out on hidden gems.
* **Inefficient Trip Planning: Planning a trip involves juggling multiple aspects—flights, accommodations, activities, and transportation. An app that streamlines this process can save time and reduce stress.
* **Difficulty Finding Outdoor Activities: Adventure enthusiasts may find it challenging to discover suitable outdoor activities, hiking trails, or adventure sports in unfamiliar locations.
* **Social Connection: Solo travelers or those seeking group adventures might want a platform to connect with like-minded individuals or local guides.
* **Real-Time Navigation: An app that provides accurate real-time navigation during outdoor adventures (hiking, biking, etc.) can enhance safety and enjoyment.
## 3. Platform
* **Operating System**:
     * Android is the primary OS for mobile devices. You’ll build your app specifically for Android smartphones and tablets.
	 * Use Android Studio, the official integrated development environment (IDE) for Android app development.
	 * Leverage Java or Kotlin as your programming language for Android app development.
* **Minimum OS Version:	
     * Determine the minimum Android version your app will support. This decision affects the features and APIs you can use.
     * Consider factors like market share, security updates, and user base when choosing the minimum version.
     * Targeting Android 6.0 (Marshmallow) or higher is a reasonable choice.
## 4. Front/Back End Support
* **Front End Support**:
     * User Interface (UI): Design and develop the app’s visual elements, including screens, buttons, navigation, and user interactions.
	 * Front-End Frameworks: Consider using React Native (for cross-platform development) or Android Studio (for native Android apps).
	 * User Experience (UX): Ensure a smooth, intuitive flow for users.
	 * API Integration: Connect to back-end services via APIs (e.g., fetching travel data, user authentication).
* **Back End Support**:
     * Server Infrastructure: Set up servers to handle requests from the app.
	 * Database: Store user profiles, travel plans, bookings, and other data. Consider using Firebase, MySQL, or MongoDB.

     * APIs: Create APIs for features like flight search, hotel booking, and itinerary management.
     * Cloud Services: Use cloud platforms (e.g., AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure) for scalability and reliability.
* **Additional Considerations**:
     * Payment Gateway: If your app involves transactions (e.g., booking flights or accommodations), integrate a payment gateway (e.g., Stripe, PayPal).
     * Push Notifications: Implement notifications for flight updates, booking confirmations, etc.
     * Analytics: Track user behavior, app performance, and engagement.
